    # Profile

    description= _ "To the Dunefolk, alchemy is less a form of philosophy or science, and more an extension of the phytology that is practiced by herbalists. However, in contrast to their brethrenâ€™s focus on herbs for medicine and healing, many alchemists utilize various plants and naturally occurring venoms to concoct lethal poisons. While useful for weakening tough enemies, this art is viewed warily by other Dunefolk as a potent means for espionage and assassination. At the same time, such a tool presents a tremendous political advantage, so much so that almost every caravan will hire or train a few alchemists to maintain a reasonable level of threat at all times."
