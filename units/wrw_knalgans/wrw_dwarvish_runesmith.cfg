    description= _ "Dwarvish runesmiths, now practiced at their craft, carve arcane runes into their weapons and armor. These runes infuse the runesmithâ€™s blows with power and accuracy, and disrupt the blows of their enemies, causing them to strike softly, weakly and on the armor of the defender."
