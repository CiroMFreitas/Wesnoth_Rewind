"+_"The <bold>text='Rebels'</bold> are a faction of <ref>text='Elves' dst='..race_elf'</ref> and their various forest-dwelling allies. They get their human name, Rebels, from the time of Heir to the Throne, when they started the rebellion against the evil Queen Asheviere. Elves are a magical race that are masters of the bow and are capable of living many years longer than humans. In harmony with nature, the elves find allies with the <ref>text='human' dst='..race_human'</ref> mages, certain <ref>text='merfolk' dst='..race_merman'</ref>, and tree creatures called <ref>text='Woses' dst='..race_wose'</ref>. Rebels are best played taking advantage of their high forest defense, mastery of ranged attacks, and the elvesâ€™ neutral alignment."
